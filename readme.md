## Choo's Clocks
This is a wristwatch simulator. The web version is primarily a toy/demo, because the countdown timer and alarm are only practical to use for small durations on mobile devices. The Android version schedules local notifications to enable notifications to work even when the device is in doze mode.  Both versions use a common codebase for the UI, built on vanilla Typescript, HTML, CSS, and SVG. CapacitorJS is used to convert this into a functional Android application and provide access to the notification system.

### Features
This simulator includes time displays in digital and analog formats, a countdown timer with hourglass animation, stopwatch, and alarm.  The UI implements an experimental curved interface which rotates to show the current selection at the bottom.
