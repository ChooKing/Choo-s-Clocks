This is a wristwatch simulator. The web version is primarily a toy/demo, because the countdown timer and alarm are only practical to use for small durations on mobile devices. The Android version schedules local notifications to enable notifications to work even when the device is in doze mode.  Both versions use a common codebase for the UI, built on vanilla Typescript, HTML, CSS, and SVG. CapacitorJS is used to convert this into a functional Android application and provide access to the notification system.
